You're given an array of integers and an integer. Write a function that moves all instances of that integer in the array to the end of the array and returns the array.
The function should perform this in place, i.e don't create a new array.
You don't need to maintain the order of integers.

for example

array = [2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 2]
to move = 2

output = [1, 3, 4, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2] // the number 1, 3 and 4 could be ordered in any way.

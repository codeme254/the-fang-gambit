// A subproblem is a problem we have to solve along the way to solving the main problem.

A palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards eg "aba", "a", "race car", empty string is also a palindrome, "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"

We usually ignore the special characters eg punctuation marks and spaces inside the string when checking for a palindrome.

Given a string, determine if it is a palindrome, considering only alphanumeric characters and ignoring case sensitivity.
"aabaa" :true
"aabbaa" :true
"abc" : false
"a" : true
"" : true
"A man, a plan, a canal: Panama" : true.

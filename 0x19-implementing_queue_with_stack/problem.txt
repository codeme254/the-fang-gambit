Implement a class queue using stacks. The queue methods you need to implement are enqueue, dequeue, peek and empty

enqueue: append a value to the end of the queue.
dequeue: Remove a value at the start of the queue.
peek: return a value at the start of the queue.
empty: return a boolean value of whether the queue is empty or not.

Constraints:
Do the queue methods we have to implement need to perform at the same complexity of a real queue.?
No but they should be as performant as possible

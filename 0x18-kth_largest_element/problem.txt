Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return the kth largest element in the array.
Note that, it is the kth largest element in the sorted order and not the kth distinct element.

[3, 2, 1, 5, 6, 4], k = 2, return 5
[3, 2, 3, 1, 2, 4, 5, 5, 6] k=4 return 4

[1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4] k = 4, return 2

contraints
k will always be greater than or equal to 1

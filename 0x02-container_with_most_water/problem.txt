You are given an array of positive integers where each integer represents the height of a vertical line on a chart. Find two lines which together with the x-axis forms a container that would hold the greatest amount of water. Return the area of the water it would hold.


CONSTRAINTS
Does the thickness of the lines affect the area? No, assume they take up no space.
Do the left and right sides count as walls? No the sides cannot be used to form a container.
Does a higher line inside our container affect the area ? No, lines inside a container don't affect the area.

[7, 1, 2, 3, 9]
obviously 7 and 9
length = smaller of the two i.e 7
width = index of 9 - index of 7 i.e 4 - 0 = 4
area = 7 * 4 = 28.


[] = 0
[9] = 0

[6, 9, 3, 4, 5, 8] = 9 and 8 = 8 * 4 = 32

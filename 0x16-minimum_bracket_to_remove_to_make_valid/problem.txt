Given a string containing only round brackets '(' and ')' and lowercase characters, remove the least amount of brackets so that the string is valid.
A string is considered valid if it is empty or if there are brackets, they all close.

a)bc(d) minimum amount of brackets to remove is 1
(ab(c)a minimum amount of brackets to remove is 1
))(( minimum amoun tof brackets to remove is 4 (all of them)

What do we return from our algorithm?
return a valid string with fewest brackets removed.

Will there be spaces in the string.
No the string only contains lowercase characters and '(' and ')'

Is a string containing only lowercase characters valid?
Yes, you don't need any brackets for a string to be valid.

a)bc(d) - abc(d)
(ab(c)d - ab(c)d or (abc)d
))(( - ""

Given two non-empty arrays of integers, write a function that determines whether the second array is a sub-sequence of the first one.


A sub-sequence of an array is a set of numbers that aren't necessarily adjacent in the array but that are in the same order as they appear in the array.

For instance, the numbers [1, 3, 4] form a sub-sequence of the array [1, 2, 3, 4] and so do the numbers [2, 4]. Note that a single number in an array and the array itself are both valid sub-sequences of the array.

e.g
array = [5, 1, 22, 25, 6, -1, 8, 10]
sequence = [1, 6, -1, 10]
output = true

Given two strings S and T, return if they are equal when both are type out.
Any '#' that appears in the string counts as backspace.

e.g
"cb#d" -> typed to "cd" // the hash deleted the b

S: "ab#c" T: "az#c"
S: "ac" T: "ac"
and thus true will be returned.

What happens when two # appear beside each other ? Delete two values before the first #
eg "ab##" === ""    "abc##" === "a"

What happens to hashes when there is no character to remove? It deletes nothing, just like backspace key on the keyboard would do
"a###b" === "b"

Are two empty strings equal to each other? Yes consider two empty strings as equal
S: "x#y#z#" T: "k#"
S: ""   T: ""

Does case sensitivity matter? Yes it does, "a" does not equal "A".


Test cases
==========
S: "ab#z" T: "az#z" true
S: "abc#d" T: "acc#c" false
S: "x#y#z#" T: "a#" true
S: "a###b" T: "b" true
S: "Ab#z" T: "ab#z" false

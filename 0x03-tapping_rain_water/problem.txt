Given an array of integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, return how much rainwater can be trapped.

Constraints
Do the left and the right sides of the graph count as walls? No, the sides are not walls.
Will there be negative integers? No, assume all integers will be positive.

Test cases
[0, 1, 0, 2, 1, 0, 3, 1, 0, 1, 2] should return 8.
[] returns 0
[3] returns 0

[3, 4, 3] returns 0, looking at the graph below, no rainwater can be tapped. Any water would flow out on the sides.

4_ |   __
3_ |__|  |__
2_ |  |  |  |
1_ |__|__|__|__

Hint for a brute force solution:
At any array point p or rather at any point p,
the rainwater able to be stored at that point is calculated by:
Taking the maximum of all values to its left, eg maxLeft
Taking the maximum of all values to its right, eg maxRight
Taking the minimum of maxLeft and maxRight min(maxLeft, maxRight)
Subtracting current heght from the minimum above

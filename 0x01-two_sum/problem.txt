Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers that add up to a given target

[1, 3, 7, 9, 2] target = 11, will return 3 and 4 since arr[3] i.e 9 and arr[4] i.e 2 add up to 11

CONSTRAINTS
Are all numbers positive or can there be negatives:-> ALL NUMBERS ARE POSITIVE.

Are there duplicate numbers in the array: -> NO THERE ARE NO DUPLICATES

Will there always be a solution available: -> NO, THERE MAY NOT ALWAYS BE A SOLUTION e.g [1, 3, 7, 9, 2] target = 25, there will be no solution

What do we return if there is no solution: -> JUST RETURN NULL

Can there be multiple pairs that add up to target: -> NO, ONLY 1 PAIR ADD UP TO TARGET.

TEST CASES
==========
[2, 3, 7, 9, 2] t=11 returns 3 and 4
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5] t=25
[] t=3
[5] t = 8
[5] t = 5
[1, 6] t = 7
